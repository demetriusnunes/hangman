= HANGMAN in SHOES

A really simple Hangman game, that fetches random words from the Internet.

My motivation for this game was for learning purposes only.

It currently uses this website for words:

This game is implemented using the Shoes GUI toolkit (Raisins - r1134):

This code can also be downloaded from:
